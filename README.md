# Robot Project: AprilTag Simulation with Camera Bot

This project simulates a mobile robot equipped with a camera inside a Gazebo world containing an AprilTag. It demonstrates how to integrate the `apriltag_ros` package to detect fiducial markers in a simulated environment.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Custom Gazebo world (`apriltag_world.world`) with an AprilTag marker.
- `camera_bot` robot model with integrated camera sensor.
- Launch file to:
  - Start Gazebo with the custom world.
  - Launch the `apriltag_ros` node to detect AprilTags.
- ROS 2 launch system using Python (`.launch.py` file
